# 20-Newsgroup
Machine Learning Project

• Preprocessed the 20 Newsgroup dataset which is a collection of 18846 data entries across 20 different topics and visualized its statistical information by term-frequency distribution. Learned Bag-of-words and TF-IDF for all the documents

• Trained a LDA model and visualized topics via pyLDAvis and Word Cloud. Trained Word2Vec and Doc2Vec model and visualized learned word and document embedding space using t-SNE

• Conducted document clustering by K-means with four different docs (BoW, TF-IDF, Topic distribution, Doc2Vec) for the whole vocabulary and top 2k words from vocabulary. Got the K-means clustering result by NMI for each doc

• Performed SVMs, RNNs, Naïve Bayes supervised algorithms on TF-IDF representation and did experiment analysis from NMI, Accuracy and Recall
